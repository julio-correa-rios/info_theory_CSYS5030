# info_theory_CSYS5030
Python translation of the Matlab tutorials in CSYS5030 - Information Theory and Self Organisation

This project corresponds to one of the capstone projects unit of the Master of Complex Systems at USyd. I *'translated'* almost all the tutorials, originally written in Matlab, into Python. 

The structure of the project is as follows:

1. Folders with the name **Modulei**, i ranging from 1 to 7, contain each module's tutorial notebook. There are no solutions in there.
2. Folder with name Solutions contains three folders:<br>
2.1. Basics: Where it will be possible to find all the basics calculations of the Information Theoretical measures<br>
2.2. SPR: Containing the analysis of the Scissors-Paper_Rock Gameplay from the perspective of Information Theory<br>
2.3. Statistical_inference: This contains the notebooks with the solutions of the tutorials where the JIDT toolkit is used<br>
