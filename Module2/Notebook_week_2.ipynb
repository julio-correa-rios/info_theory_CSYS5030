    "In this exercise we continue to alter the Python code in the next cell to measure the Shannon entropy. This time, let's code it not from a given distribution p(x), but from empirical data of samples x of the variable X.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to edit the function entropyempirical(xn) in the next cell to return the Shannon entropy for the given samples  ùë•ùëõ  of X (n is the sample index). Note that the input  ùë•ùëõ  is a vector, with each entry representing one sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examine the code template in the next cell. The first task the code performs is to work out the alphabet A_X (contained in the variable symbols) that the samples are drawn from. Then the code template counts the number of occurrences of each symbol of the alphabet in the samples, normalises those counts into probabilities, and then computes the entropy from that. Fill out the code to perform these tasks where indicated with ???.\n",

That is, <b>p</b> is a matrix with the (i,j)th entry in the matrix giving the probability for the joint outcome of the ith value that x may take along with the jth value that y may take. The sum of the items in the matrix p must be 1.\n",

Come up with some other test cases to check, e.g. could you check similar boundary cases to what we used to test <b>entropy(p)</b> in the previous module?\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Challenge: try dropping the assumption that the input argument <b>p</b> is of 2 dimensions, but allow it to be a matrix of arbitrary dimensions. Can you do this with minimal changes to the code? Hint: calling p(:) where <b>p</b> is a matrix of any number of dimensions will return a one dimensional array.\n"
